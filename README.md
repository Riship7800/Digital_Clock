# DigitalClock
A digital clock can be created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by displaying the current time in an HTML element. CSS is used to style the clock, giving it a modern look. JavaScript is employed to update the time every second, ensuring that the clock displays accurate hours, minutes, and seconds. 
*I have created digital clocks based on different css and gradient patterns
  -The digitalClock1 is a simple clock with date and time.
  -The digitalClock2 shows just time but its designed good.
